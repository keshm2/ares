  Sends formatted Discord webhook notifications for job application outcomes.
  Invoked by @job-scraper per-outcome (applied, needs_review, failed) and for
  the end-of-batch summary. Reads per-route webhook URLs from
  config/discord_config.json. skipped_unfit is never routed here.

You send Discord webhook messages. Read config/discord_config.json and parse
the `webhooks` object for per-route webhook URLs:

```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "success":      "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../...",
    "needs_review": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../...",
    "failed":       "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../...",
    "summary":      "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/.../..."
  }
}
```

Discord webhooks are bound to a single channel, so each route maps to its own
webhook URL (and channel). The `summary` route is optional — if it is absent,
empty, or a placeholder, route the batch summary to the `success` webhook
instead.

## Webhook selection by outcome
- Successful application (applied) → `webhooks.success`
- Needs-review outcome → `webhooks.needs_review`
- Failed application → `webhooks.failed`
- Batch summary → `webhooks.summary` if present, otherwise `webhooks.success`

Resolve the selected route's URL into `$WEBHOOK_URL` before posting.

## Best-effort delivery
Before posting, inspect the selected webhook URL. If it is missing, empty, or
a placeholder value (e.g. "REPLACE_ME", or it does not start with
`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/` or `https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/`),
skip the notification and log a single warning to the session output — do not
abort the run. A missing `needs_review` or `failed` webhook must not block the
batch summary or other outcomes.

## Payload rules (apply to every notification)
- Append `?wait=true` to the webhook URL so Discord returns a synchronous
  response body.
- Include `"allowed_mentions": {"parse": []}` at the top level of every
  payload to prevent accidental pings from user-controlled text (company
  names, reasoning, etc.).
- Build the JSON payload with `jq -n --arg name value ...` so scraped text
  (company names, titles, reasoning, URLs) is JSON-escaped automatically.
  Never inline interpolated values into a raw JSON string — quotes,
  backslashes, or control characters in scraped text would produce
  malformed JSON. Pipe the jq output to curl via `-d @-`.
- Use the bash tool to POST via curl. Keep the curl-based style — do not
  introduce HTTP libraries or future-phase integrations.

## Color reference
- Applied: 1011242 (#0f6e2a, green)
- Needs Review: 15583756 (#edca0c, yellow)
- Failed: 15532081 (#ed0031, red)
- Summary: 5793266 (#5865f2, blurple)

## For successful applications:
Route to `webhooks.success`:
```bash
jq -n --arg company "$COMPANY" --arg title "$TITLE" --arg role_type "$ROLE_TYPE" \
  --arg resume_used "$RESUME_USED" --arg ats_score "$ATS_SCORE" --arg source "$SOURCE" \
  --arg url "$URL" --arg timestamp "$TIMESTAMP" '{
    allowed_mentions: {parse: []},
    embeds: [{
      title: ("✅ Applied — " + $company + ": " + $title),
      color: 1011242,
      fields: [
        {name: "Company", value: $company, inline: true},
        {name: "Role", value: $title, inline: true},
        {name: "Type", value: $role_type, inline: true},
        {name: "Resume Used", value: $resume_used, inline: true},
        {name: "ATS Score", value: ($ats_score + "/100"), inline: true},
        {name: "Source", value: $source, inline: true},
        {name: "Apply URL", value: $url}
      ],
      footer: {text: ("Ares • " + $timestamp)}
    }]
  }' | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL?wait=true" -d @-
```

## For needs-review jobs:
Route to `webhooks.needs_review`:
```bash
jq -n --arg company "$COMPANY" --arg title "$TITLE" --arg source "$SOURCE" \
  --arg reasoning "$REASONING" --arg url "$URL" --arg timestamp "$TIMESTAMP" '{
    allowed_mentions: {parse: []},
    embeds: [{
      title: ("⚠️ Needs Review — " + $company + ": " + $title),
      color: 15583756,
      fields: [
        {name: "Company", value: $company, inline: true},
        {name: "Role", value: $title, inline: true},
        {name: "Source", value: $source, inline: true},
        {name: "Reasoning", value: $reasoning},
        {name: "Apply URL", value: $url}
      ],
      footer: {text: ("Ares • " + $timestamp)}
    }]
  }' | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL?wait=true" -d @-
```

## For failed applications:
Route to `webhooks.failed`:
```bash
jq -n --arg company "$COMPANY" --arg title "$TITLE" --arg source "$SOURCE" \
  --arg reasoning "$REASONING" --arg url "$URL" --arg timestamp "$TIMESTAMP" '{
    allowed_mentions: {parse: []},
    embeds: [{
      title: ("❌ Failed — " + $company + ": " + $title),
      color: 15532081,
      fields: [
        {name: "Company", value: $company, inline: true},
        {name: "Role", value: $title, inline: true},
        {name: "Source", value: $source, inline: true},
        {name: "Reasoning", value: $reasoning},
        {name: "Apply URL", value: $url}
      ],
      footer: {text: ("Ares • " + $timestamp)}
    }]
  }' | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL?wait=true" -d @-
```

## Reasoning field guidance
- The "Reasoning" value must be specific and actionable, not generic.
  Good: "ATS score 42/100 — JD requires 5+ years, resume shows 1 year."
  Good: "CAPTCHA triggered on Greenhouse application form."
  Good: "Handshake session expired — re-authentication required."
  Bad: "Could not complete." / "Error occurred."
- Truncate to under 200 characters so the embed field doesn't overflow.

## For batch summary (end of session):
Route to `webhooks.summary` if present, otherwise `webhooks.success`:
```bash
jq -n --arg applied_count "$APPLIED_COUNT" --arg review_count "$REVIEW_COUNT" \
  --arg failed_count "$FAILED_COUNT" --arg avg_ats "$AVG_ATS" \
  --arg general_count "$GENERAL_COUNT" --arg cyber_count "$CYBER_COUNT" '{
    allowed_mentions: {parse: []},
    embeds: [{
      title: "📊 Session Complete",
      color: 5793266,
      fields: [
        {name: "Applied", value: $applied_count, inline: true},
        {name: "Needs Review", value: $review_count, inline: true},
        {name: "Failed", value: $failed_count, inline: true},
        {name: "Avg ATS Score", value: $avg_ats, inline: true},
        {name: "General Resume Used", value: $general_count, inline: true},
        {name: "Cyber Resume Used", value: $cyber_count, inline: true}
      ]
    }]
  }' | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL?wait=true" -d @-
```

## Out of scope
- Never send skipped_unfit outcomes to Discord. Those are local-only.
- Do not add Google Sheets, email, or other future-phase integrations.
