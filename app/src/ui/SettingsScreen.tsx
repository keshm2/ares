/**
 * Settings tab: view and edit the config that drives applyr —
 * personal info (config/targets.json safe_fields), Discord webhooks
 * (config/discord_config.json), and persisted APPLYR_* environment
 * overrides (config/env.json, exported by the runner; a real env var
 * always wins).
 *
 * Every interactive list (section list, field list, choice menus,
 * checklists, search suggestions) uses the same `[x]`/`[ ]` bracket
 * convention — `[✓]` in submenus marks an actual SELECTED value (a
 * saved single-select choice, a checked category, an already-added
 * search result), never just cursor position (that's the separate `>`
 * arrow). Field-list rows show ONLY the label — no inline value dump —
 * so the list never overflows into packed, unreadable comma-separated
 * text; a field's current value is only ever shown INSIDE its own edit
 * popup, not as a standing summary line.
 *
 * Every edit opens as a bordered "popup" beneath the (dimmed, so the
 * popup reads as the thing in front) field list — Ink has no real
 * floating/z-index layer to draw a true overlay on, so this is the
 * closest approximation: a visually distinct, boldly-bordered panel
 * that appears to rise from the row you opened, not just more content
 * appended at the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * Checklist/choice/search submenus write through to disk on every
 * toggle — pressing enter/space on an option takes effect immediately
 * (same instant-effect feel as the Discord "Enabled" toggle), so there
 * is nothing left to commit when you leave; Escape's only job in those
 * three is to close the popup. The plain single-value text editor
 * (personal info, Discord webhook URLs, env overrides) is the one
 * exception — Enter still saves it and Escape still discards an
 * in-progress edit, unchanged from before.
