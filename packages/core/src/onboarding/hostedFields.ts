/**
 * Pure field-id classification for hosted-mode routing (SupabaseAdapter) —
 * deliberately split from profile.ts, which also holds the fs-backed
 * local-mode read/write functions. SupabaseAdapter runs directly in the
 * Tauri webview (no Node APIs available there), so anything it imports
 * must stay free of node:fs/node:child_process — importing profile.ts
 * itself would pull those in transitively even though only these two
 * constant lists are needed.
 *
 * HOSTED_PROFILE_FIELD_IDS: the safe_fields-shaped subset of the 18
 * onboarding fields — the PII the operator has explicitly approved
 * syncing to the hosted Supabase `profiles` table (2026-07-16 decision, a
 * deliberate override of phase 11's original local-only-PII default).
 * HOSTED_PREFERENCE_FIELD_IDS: job-search preferences (role_keywords,
 * preferred_locations, target_companies) — not PII, stored in a separate
 * jsonb column since they only become meaningful once synced into a local
 * install's config/targets.json for the Python fit-gate engine (Phase 14B).
