"""The single place that knows how each coding agent is invoked.

AGENTS.md "Harness capability matrix": *"the only harness-specific code is
the adapter block in scripts/runtime/run_job_agent.sh (never add harness
branches anywhere else)"*. That rule was easy to honor while `run_job_agent`
was the only thing that launched an agent. Interest-letter generation
(work item #4) needs to launch one too, so rather than grow a second copy of
the argv shapes, the adapter moved here and both callers import it. This
module IS that adapter block — the rule now reads "the only harness-specific
code lives in harness_adapter.py".

Two capability facts drive everything below (see the matrix in AGENTS.md):

  - opencode and Claude Code have a **subagent registry**, so an agent is
    named directly (`--agent <name>` / a generated `.claude/agents/` def).
  - Codex and Copilot have **no registry**, so the agent's body must be
    inlined into the prompt with an explicit "read this file and act as it"
    instruction — the documented inline fallback.

Keeping both shapes here is what makes a new agent work on all four harnesses
by construction instead of by remembering to update four call sites.
