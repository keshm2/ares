#
# The runner logic now lives in scripts/run_job_agent.py so it runs natively
# on Windows (PowerShell/cmd) as well as macOS/Linux with a single codebase.
# This shim keeps existing crontab/launchd entries that point at the .sh
# working unchanged — it just execs the Python runner, forwarding arguments.
#
# Schedule (unchanged): the 30-minute launchd job installed by scheduler.sh
# invokes this file; it in turn runs run_job_agent.py.
