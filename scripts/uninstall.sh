#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh          # interactive (asks before deleting)
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --yes    # no prompts (still prints what it did)
#   bash scripts/uninstall.sh --keep-data
#                                      # remove schedule + command, keep the

#
# What it removes, in order:
#   1. The launchd schedule (scripts/scheduler.sh uninstall).
#   2. The `applyr` wrapper on PATH — only if it is applyr's own wrapper
#      pointing at THIS install.
#   3. The install directory itself — this holds your live config, data,
#      logs, and resumes (PII), so it is only deleted after an explicit
#      confirmation (or --yes).
#
# npm installs: `npm uninstall -g @keshm2/applyr` removes the globally
# installed TUI command (this script prints a reminder when it detects
# one). The npm package never owns the core directory — this script does.
