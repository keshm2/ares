/**
 * Populates the shared Supabase job_cache table (see
 * supabase/migrations/0003_job_cache.sql) so searchJobs()'s cache checks
 * (jobCache.ts) actually have something to hit. NOT part of this
 * package's public export surface (see package.json's "exports" map —
 * this file is deliberately absent from it) and never imported by any
 * TUI/desktop entry point, so it never ships inside app/'s bundled CLI
 * or the desktop app's Node subprocess bridge.
 *
 * Run standalone, holding the Supabase secret key (Project Settings →
 * API Keys → "Secret keys" — sb_secret_..., the current replacement for
 * the legacy service_role JWT; authorizes via the same service_role
 * Postgres role and still sets BYPASSRLS, so it bypasses RLS identically.
 * This is the only thing in the whole codebase that should ever hold
 * that key; it must never reach config/supabase.json, a client bundle,
 * or any file that gets committed):
 *
 *   SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_... node packages/core/dist/refreshJobCache.js
 *
 * Locally, the project URL comes from config/supabase.json (same file
 * the desktop app reads). In CI (.github/workflows/refresh-job-cache.yml,
 * scheduled every 90 minutes — under job_cache's 2h TTL) that file
 * doesn't exist on a fresh checkout, so SUPABASE_URL is read as a direct
 * override first — not secret, just the project's own URL, stored as a
 * plain repo secret alongside SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY for convenience.
 *
 * Refreshes the four sources that support a full, unfiltered board fetch
 * — Ashby, Lever, Greenhouse, SmartRecruiters — using
 * config/job_cache_targets.json's company slugs. That file is
 * deliberately separate from config/targets.json (gitignored, holds this
 * operator's personal profile/PII) — it's committed, so a CI checkout
 * can see it, and it must only ever hold company slugs. Every row is
 * written under query='' (see jobCache.ts's header for why: query-string
 * matching happens downstream against the merged result set, identically
 * whether a job came from cache or a live fetch).
 *
 * Amazon/Oracle/Workday are Python-backed and query-parameterized (their
 * APIs don't offer a "list everything" mode the way the four above do —
 * see jobs.ts's fetchAmazon/fetchOracle/fetchWorkday) — deliberately
 * left out of this first pass rather than guessing at a query set to
 * seed them with. searchJobs() already skips the cache check for those
 * three entirely (see maybeCached's call sites in jobs.ts), so this gap
 * is inert, not silently broken.
