# agents/ — single source of truth for agent behavior

The per-harness agent definitions are **generated**; never edit
`.opencode/agents/*` or `.claude/agents/*` directly.

- `bodies/<name>.md` — the harness-neutral prompt body (the behavior).
- `frontmatter/opencode/<name>.yaml` — opencode frontmatter (models,
  temperature, mode). Model IDs here are the operator's local choice
  until the phase 12 tier registry lands.
- `frontmatter/claude/<name>.yaml` — Claude Code frontmatter
  (`model: inherit` — the runtime model comes from the user's Claude
  Code session, never pinned here).

Regenerate after editing any source:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_agent_definitions.py          # write
python3 scripts/generate_agent_definitions.py --check  # drift check (CI / pre-run)
```

`scripts/run_job_agent.sh` runs the drift check at the start of every
run and warns (does not block) when the generated files are stale.

Harness capability contract (what a driver must provide): subagent
invocation, a shell tool, file read/write, and Playwright MCP for
browser-driven boards. Both opencode and Claude Code provide all four;
a harness missing browser automation must degrade to API-fed boards
plus review-only routing (see PLAN.md phase 16).
