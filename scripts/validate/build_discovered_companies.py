"""build_discovered_companies.py — derive a large company+ATS+slug
directory from SimplifyJobs' public listing feeds.

The hand-vetted lists (config/{ashby,lever,greenhouse}_vetted_slugs.json)
are deliberately small — every entry there was individually verified
against its ATS's public API by a human, in a PR. This script covers the
opposite end of the tradeoff: it mines SimplifyJobs' much larger,
community-maintained internship/new-grad listing feeds (the same feeds
scripts/jobs/fetch_simplify_listings.py already fetches at runtime) for
job-posting URLs that reveal a company's Ashby/Lever/Greenhouse slug,
and writes every (company, vendor, slug) tuple it can parse out to
config/discovered_companies.json.

This is NOT hand-verified the way the vetted lists are — it's a
best-effort regex extraction over third-party data, reviewed here only
in aggregate (a real run against ~15k listings resolves ATS+slug for
roughly a third of the distinct companies present; the rest use
Workday, SmartRecruiters, Oracle Cloud, iCIMS, Workable, or a fully
custom careers page, none of which this script attempts to parse).
app/src/data/companyDirectory.ts tags every entry from this file
tier: "discovered" and ranks it below "vetted" entries on a search-score
tie (see autocomplete.ts's filterSuggestions `weightOf` and
companyDirectory.ts's companyWeight).

SimplifyJobs' repos (github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships,
github.com/SimplifyJobs/New-Grad-Positions) have no LICENSE file as of
this writing — there is no explicit written grant to redistribute a
derived dataset. This project already fetches the same raw JSON at
runtime for job listings (an established, narrower use); caching a
derived company/slug directory is a related but distinct downstream
use worth revisiting if this project's distribution ever broadens.

This is a manual/periodic refresh, not part of any automated run or
schedule — re-run it by hand when you want a bigger/fresher company
pool, review the diff, and commit it like any other vetted-list change.
