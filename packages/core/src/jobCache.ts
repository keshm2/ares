// Cache lookups must never make a search feel slower than today. Tuned
// against the live table: a full 4-source, ~35-company concurrent batch
// measured 232-655ms unfiltered (jd_text is the dominant per-row cost —
// see UNFILTERED_PER_COMPANY_LIMIT/FILTERED_PER_COMPANY_LIMIT below),
// with real margin below this budget. If a lookup doesn't come back
// within it, falling through to the existing live fetch (its own,
// longer per-source budget — see SOURCE_DEADLINE_MS in jobs.ts) is
// always the safer failure mode.

// Per company, not overall. Capping per company (via the job_cache_search
// RPC's lateral join, not a plain global LIMIT) is load-bearing: a
// global LIMIT across N companies returns Postgres's first-scanned rows
// combined, which in practice let 1-2 companies fill the whole cap and
// left every other configured company with zero results even though
// real cached rows existed for them (see migration 0004's header).
//
// Two different limits, not one — measured live, they have very
// different cost profiles now that the RPC pre-filters by title
// (migration 0005) before applying either cap:
// - UNFILTERED_PER_COMPANY_LIMIT (browsing, no search query typed):
//   10, picked empirically — measured live at 10/15/25/40 across all
//   four sources, and 10 was the last value with consistently fast
//   (sub-second), non-spiky latency; 15 already showed occasional 2s
//   spikes. jd_text (full description text, required so checkJobFit()
//   works on cache-derived jobs without a live refetch) is what makes
//   row count this expensive with nothing narrowing the row set first.
// - FILTERED_PER_COMPANY_LIMIT (a real search query, so titleWords is
//   non-empty): the ILIKE pre-filter already narrows each company down
//   to plausibly-relevant rows before this cap ever applies, so a much
//   higher cap costs almost nothing — measured live, raising a
//   pre-filtered query from 10 to 75 went 77ms -> 103ms. Confirmed live
//   this mattered: a real "software engineer intern" search had 19
//   matching rows sitting past the old shared 10-cap for one source
//   alone, silently excluded even though the RPC had already filtered
//   down to genuine candidates.
// Matches jobs.ts's MAX_PAGE_SIZE — a merged, deduped, final result
// page can never exceed that regardless of source, so there's no
// value in capping any single company past it.

// are covered. Words shorter than MIN_PREFIX_LEN are left whole — the

 *
 * This is the SEARCH SCOPE fix, distinct from (and found after) the
 * earlier coverage-safety fix: it's not enough to just make sure a
 * user's own configured companies never get silently dropped when
 * they're absent from the shared cache — the shared cache's OTHER
 * companies (the ones a user never personally configured, like SpaceX
 * for most installs) were never being searched AT ALL, cache or no
 * cache, because searchJobs() only ever iterated a source's *personal*
 * slug list. The whole reason job_cache_targets.json is a curated,
 * broader company list in the first place — "so users have a lot of
 * options to apply to" — never actually took effect; the cache was
 * only ever speeding up and correctly covering a user's own existing
 * (often narrow) list, never expanding what got searched. Confirmed
 * live: SpaceX (only in the shared list, not any tested personal one)
 * never appeared in results for any query, no matter how broad.
 *
 * Callers (jobs.ts's maybeCached) union this with a source's personal
 * slug list — the shared list is always searched via cache; whichever
 * of the user's own companies aren't already part of it get live-fetched
 * on top, so nothing from either list is ever dropped.
 *
 * Never throws — a missing/unreadable file just means the shared list is
 * empty, which safely falls back to exactly the old personal-list-only
 * behavior rather than breaking search.
